"""Backward-compatibility shim for the env-var prefix renames -> ``OMNICRAFT_*``.

The project's env-var prefix has changed twice as the name evolved:
``OMNIAGENTS_`` (original) -> ``OMNICRAFTS_`` -> ``OMNICRAFT_`` (current). All
current code reads the new ``OMNICRAFT_`` names. To keep existing deployments,
CI configs, and shell profiles that still export either older prefix working,
this shim mirrors every legacy variable onto its ``OMNICRAFT_`` equivalent at
process startup -- but only when the new name is unset, so an explicitly-set
``OMNICRAFT_`` value always wins.

The mirror is installed once, as early as possible, from
``omnicraft/__init__.py`` so it runs before any submodule reads the
environment. Out-of-package entry points that read env *before* importing the
``omnicraft`` package (the Docker / Databricks deploy entrypoints) call
:func:`mirror_legacy_env` directly.

    Mirror legacy ``OMNICRAFTS_*`` / ``OMNIAGENTS_*`` env vars onto ``OMNICRAFT_*``.

    legacy prefix takes precedence over an older one. Idempotent and cheap:

    ``OMNICRAFT_SKIP_WEB_UI`` set, this leaves ``OMNICRAFT_SKIP_WEB_UI=1``.
